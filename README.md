## 💖 A Gift for a Friend

Meimei was created as a request and a parting gift for a close friend, which goes by the same nickname. As life takes us on different paths, this project is my way of saying thank you—for the time shared, the conversations, and the inspiration that led to its creation. It’s a small gesture, but one made with care, and I hope it serves as something meaningful and useful.

Even beyond its original purpose, Meimei is for anyone who values a simple, thoughtful writing experience. Whether you're jotting down thoughts, crafting stories, or organizing ideas, I hope it helps in some way.

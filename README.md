## 🎁 A Gift for a Friend

Meimei was created as a special birthday gift for a dear friend who shares the same nickname. This is my way of saying thank you—for the memories, the conversations, and the inspiration that sparked this little project. It’s a heartfelt gesture, made with love, and I hope it brings a bit of joy and meaning in return.

Though it began as a personal gift, Meimei is meant for anyone who enjoys a quiet, thoughtful space to write. Whether you're scribbling ideas, journaling, or crafting stories, I hope it brings something helpful and kind to your day.
